            <h3>Git Push</h3>
            <p><span style="color: #7dcbbd">Git push</span> is how we get our code to GitHub, an excellent place to store all of our repositories. Other developers might look at our exsisting projects to see how 
                we approached problems, pull down our code and add new features or even update our code base with features they wanted to add.</p>

            <h1>What is Git?</h1>
            <p>Git is a version control system; you can think of it aas a series of snapshots (commits) of you code base.
                With the creation of each snapshot you build out a whoel application, seeing the growth of a full app. During this time 
                you can make branches to experiment and come back to a previous snapshot you took or merge those experiemts into your
                 app.
            <h1>What is GitHub</h1>
            <p>GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others ork together on prjects from anywhere
                using those code snapshots that you took during development.
